<p>09-16-18 - Week 2</h2>

1. This week I created a GitHub account and installed GitHub Desktop, and practiced creating new files (`.txt`, `.md`) and repositories in GitHub desktop, as well as changing and moving files to learn what a commit is and to show how changes will be tracked in the text editor.

2. Following the instructions, I did the following:
- Signed up for GitHub
- Installed GitHub Desktop
- Linked it to my GitHub account
- ...And used Notepad++ and Command Prompt to create the test files. 
	I chose to use Notepad++ because I am already familiar with using it to code characters and mods for the game ![Don't Starve Together](https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve-together)

3. I did not experience any issues this week.

4. I'd like to explore the hosting services of GitHub more.

5. Alas, I did not help any classmates this week.
