<p>09-16-18 - Week 2</p></h2>
<p>
<ol type="1"><ol>1. This week I created a GitHub account and installed GitHub Desktop, and practiced creating new files (`.txt`, `.md`) and repositories in GitHub desktop, as well as changing and moving files to learn what a commit is and to show how changes will be tracked in the text editor.</ol>
<p>
<p>
<ol>2. Following the instructions, I did the following:
<p> <ul style="list-style-type:square>"><li>Signed up for GitHub
<li>Installed GitHub Desktop
<li>Linked it to my GitHub account
<li> ...And used Notepad++ and Command Prompt to create the test files. 
<p>	I chose to use Notepad++ because I am already familiar with using it to code characters and mods for the game <a href="https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve-together">Don't Starve Together</a>.</ol>
<p>
<ol>3. I did not experience any issues this week.</ol>
<p>
<ol>4. I'd like to explore the hosting services of GitHub more.</ol>
<p>
<ol>5. Alas, I did not help any classmates this week.</ol>
